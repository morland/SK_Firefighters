Ultra-simple script to choose firefigters within a date range.  Parameters (start date, end date, stint length, team affiliations, etc.) are included in the code, for now.  There is a version with basic Google Calendar import functionality to pull in members' unavailable dates from the team calendar but Y'ALL AIN'T READY (actually it requires installing the Gdata Python module and I thought that would be a hassle).
